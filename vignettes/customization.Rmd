```{r setup}
library(pillar)
```

This draft describes a new backward-compatible design for making the appearance of a pillar more extensible.

The design consists of two parts:

1. Moving all formatting code into pillar
1. Adding extension points for formatting individual pillars


## Moving all formatting code into pillar

### Advantages

- Code that implements formatting for tables no longer needs tibble
- All formatting code in one package
- Simplify and document formatting code along the way
- New `as_tbl()` for attaching the `"tbl"` class to arbitrary objects (e.g. data frames or data tables) for printing

### Implementation

`format.tbl()` retains its semantics.
For compatibility it returns a character vector with one element per line.

```{r}
#' @export
format.tbl <- function(x, ...) {
  setup <- tbl_format_setup(x, width = width, n = n, n_extra = n_extra)
  header <- tbl_format_header(x, setup)
  body <- tbl_format_body(x, setup)
  footer <- tbl_format_footer(x, setup)
  c(header, body, footer)
}
```

Code and data flow are illustrated in the diagram below.
Boxes are functions and methods.
Solid lines are function calls.
Dotted lines are inputs to function calls.

```{r echo = FALSE}
DiagrammeR::mermaid("format.mmd")
```



### New generics

`tbl_format_setup()` takes the role of the (then superseded) `trunc_mat()`.
The default mimics `trunc_mat()` but returns a stable data structure that is well documented.
Classes that need to do more when setting up the printing implement a method.

Contrary to the existing logic, the width would be baked into the `setup` object.
I haven't seen a use case for formatting the same prepared object with multiple widths.

```{r}
tbl_format_setup.default <- function(x, ...) {
  trunc_mat(x, ...)
}
```

`tbl_format_header()` in the default implementation formats the output of `tbl_sum()`.
The implementer is expected to apply `style_subtle()` in case the class wants to add color or other styling.

```{r}
tbl_format_header.default <- function(x, ...) {
  sum <- tbl_sum(x)
  style_subtle(
    paste0(names(sum), ": ", sum)
  )
}
```

`tbl_format_body()` formats the colonnade prepared in the setup.
The implementation is shown further below.

`tbl_format_footer()` is copied from tibble.
The implementer is expected to apply `style_subtle()` in case the class wants to add color or other styling.

```{r}
tbl_format_footer.default <- function(x, ...) {
  style_subtle(format_footer(x, ...))
}

format_footer <- function(x, ...) {
  # Copy implementation from tibble
}
```

## Adding extension points for formatting individual pillars

### Constraints and design goals

- A pillar is rarely shown individually, most often it is part of a colonnade.
- A colonnade also is rarely shown individually, most often it is part of a larger structure like a tibble.
- All pillars in a colonnade are shown in a similar way, a single controller can decide the appearance of all pillars.
- Pillars in a colonnade are either all named or all unnamed.
- Pillars can adapt their width to the available space. Computation of minimum and maximum width can happen before formatting the actual data. For performance reasons, `colonnade()` will not construct pillar objects it doesn't need.
- A pillar has a header (=capital), body (=shaft), footer (=basis, currently not used). Design should follow `cnd_header()`, `cnd_body()` and `cnd_footer()`. These components can be of different height, will be top-aligned when printing.
- Pillars are always shown from left to right, no "holes" in the colonnade. If the first column consumes all available space, the remaining columns are not shown, even if they all would fit if the first column is omitted.
- Printing pillars should take time proportional to the number of characters printed, and be "fast enough".
- Customizing parts of the display (e.g. omit type, add more information) should be easy.
- Existing infrastructure should be supported.
- *NEW*: Support arbitrary components of a pillar, title, type, data, ... .
- *NEW*: Columns containing data frames and matrices remain supported.


### New generics

Because printing is now internal to pillar, there's no need to touch `colonnade()`.
Internally, the object to be printed is used as `controller` argument.
The default controller mimics current behavior.

Two new generics, `ctl_new_compound_pillar()` and `ctl_new_pillar()`, dispatch on that controller.
The first method needs to be aware of packed columns (matrices and data frames), the second will be called only for 1D objects.
We mostly expect overrides for `ctl_new_pillar()`, much rarer if at all for `ctl_new_compound_pillar()`.

Apart from the controller, these generics receive the object, the formatted name (which can be a vector in the case of packed data frames or matrices), and the remaining width (which can also be a vector in the case of multiple tiers, if `getOption("width") < getOption("tibble.width")`).
Both generics return a `"pillar"` object, or `NULL` if the minimum width of the pillar doesn't fit the remaining width.

```{r}
#' @export
ctl_new_compound_pillar <- function(controller, x, width, ..., title = NULL) {
  check_dots_empty()
  
  if (length(width) == 0) {
    return(NULL)
  }
  
  UseMethod("ctl_new_compound_pillar")
}

#' @export
ctl_new_compound_pillar.tbl <- function(controller, x, width, ..., title = NULL) {
  if (is.data.frame(x)) {
    new_data_frame_pillar(x, controller, width, title = title)
  } else if (is.matrix(x)) {
    new_matrix_pillar(x, controller, width, title = title)
  } else if (is.array(x)) {
    ...
  } else {
    ctl_new_pillar(controller, x, width, ..., title = title)
  }
}

#' @export
ctl_new_pillar <- function(controller, x, width, ..., title = NULL) {
  check_dots_empty()
  
  if (length(width) == 0) {
    return(NULL)
  }
  
  UseMethod("ctl_new_pillar")
}

#' @export
ctl_new_pillar.tbl <- function(controller, x, width, ..., title = NULL) {
  pillar(x, title, width)
}
```

### The `"pillar"` class

Objects of class `"pillar"` are internally a named lists of their components.
The default components are `title` (may be missing), `type`, and `data`.
Each component is a `"pillar_box"`, as described below.
Implementations may add new components or modify existing components.

```{r}
#' @export
new_pillar <- function(base = list(), ..., class = NULL) {
  structure(
    modifyList(base, list(...)),
    class = c(class, "pillar")
  )
}
```

This allows e.g.:

```{r}
#' @export
ctl_new_pillar.foo_controller <- function(controller, x, width, ..., title = NULL) {
  out <- NextMethod()
  new_pillar(out, capital = NULL, footer = ..., class = "foo_pillar")
}
```


### The `"pillar_box"` class

An object of the `"pillar_box"` class captures contents that can be fitted in a rectangle.
Each box consists of one or multiple cells that are aligned horizontally (with one space inbetween) when printed.
Each cell has a maximum (=desired) width and may have a minimum width if the contents are compressible.
The box object stores the width of the cells as an attribute.

```{r}
new_pillar_box <- function(x, width, min_width = NULL) {
  structure(
    x,
    width = width,
    min_width = min_width
    # keep class attribute from x
  )
}

get_cell_widths <- function(x) {
  attr(x, "width")
}

get_cell_min_widths <- function(x) {
  attr(x, "min_width") %||% attr(x, "width")
}
```

The cells may be stored as a list with one element per cell (for `type` and `data` components), or as a hierarchy of boxes (for the `name` component).
In the latter case, `length(x) < length(get_cell_widths(x))`, and each element must be a box.

Extraction of a contiguous range of cells is supported.

```{r}
get_cells <- function(x, from, to) {
  stopifnot(from <= to)
  
  if (length(x) < length(get_cell_widths(x))) {
    get_cells_for_hierarchy(x, from, to)
  } else {
    idx <- seq2(from, to)
    new_pillar_box(x[idx], get_cell_widths(x)[idx], get_cell_min_widths(x)[idx])
  }
}

get_cells_for_hierarchy <- function(x, from, to) {
  lengths <- map_int(x, function(.x) length(get_cell_widths(.x)))
  
  idx <- .bincode(c(from, to), lengths)
  from_idx <- idx[[1]]
  to_idx <- idx[[2]]
  
  ...
}
```

### Sub-pillars and their widths

If the components of a pillar are boxes with multiple cells, the pillar can be decomposed into sub-pillars that consist of corresponding cells from each component box.
For each sub-pillar, its width can be computed as a maximum of the cell widths of the individual boxes.

```{r}
pillar_get_widths <- function(x) {
  exec(pmax, !!!map(x, get_cell_widths))
}

pillar_get_min_widths <- function(x) {
  exec(pmax, !!!map(x, get_cell_min_widths))
}
```

Alternatively, widths can be computed once when constructing the pillar object and stored in an attribute.


### Object layout

### Implementation sketch

- The width of the tier(s) for printing is computed from `getOption("tibble.width")` and `getOption("width")`.
- We start with the assumption that each column consumes at least one character, with the space between the columns. This gives an upper bound for the number of columns and allows preallocating memory.
- The new `colonnade2()` gives us the representation of the entire data frame.
- The new implementation seamlessly supports display of matrices via `new_matrix_pillar()`.
- After the final list of pillars is known, they are distributed using the existing implementation to make use of excess space (not shown here).

```{r}
colonnade2 <- function(x, controller, has_row_id, width) {
  if (nrow(x) == 0) {
    return(NULL)
  }
  
  # Reserve space for rowid column in each tier
  if (!is_false(has_row_id)) {
    rowid_width <- trunc(log10(nrow(x)) + 1)
    width <- width - rowid_width - 1
    width <- width[width > 0]
  }
  
  new_data_frame_pillar(x, controller, width, title = NULL)
}


new_data_frame_pillar <- function(x, controller, width, title) {
  max_n_pillars <- sum(width %/% 2)
  pillars <- vector("list", max_n_pillars)
  
  for (i in seq_along(x)) {
    # Call ctl_new_compound_pillar() only for objects that can fit
    pillar <- ctl_new_compound_pillar(
      controller, x[[i]], width, 
      title = c(title, names(x)[[i]])
    )
    if (is.null(pillar)) {
      # NULL return: doesn't fit
      break
    }
    
    # Compute remaining width
    width <- deduct_width(width, pillar_get_min_widths(pillar))
    if (is.null(width)) {
      # NULL return: current pillar doesn't fit
      break
    }

    pillars[[i]] <- pillar
  }
  
  pillars <- compact(pillars)
  
  widths <- reduce(pillars, pillar_get_widths)
  min_widths <- reduce(pillars, pillar_get_min_widths)
}

# Can be rewritten with a repeat loop
deduct_width <- function(width, consumed_widths) {
  if (length(consumed_widths) == 0) {
    # All sub-pillars distributed
    width
  } else if (length(width) == 0) {
    # Doesn't fit
    NULL
  } else if (width[[1]] >= consumed_widths[[1]]) {
    # Fits first tier
    deduct_width(
      c(width[[1]] - consumed_widths[[1]], width[-1]),
      consumed_widths[-1]
    )
  } else {
    # Doesn't fit first tier: try next tier
    deduct_width(width[-1], consumed_widths)
  }
}
```

## Avoiding fetching too many columns

For `tbl_lazy`, the `[` operator doesn't work.
A new `pillar_select_cols()` generic supports querying a column subset, this speeds up the preview of queries that return too many columns.

```{r}
#' @export
pillar_select_cols <- function(x, n, ...) {
  check_dots_empty()

  UseMethod("pillar_select_cols")
}

#' @export
pillar_select_cols.default <- function(x, n, ...) {
  x
}

#' @export
pillar_select_cols.data.frame <- function(x, n, ...) {
  x[seq_len(n)]
}

# in dbplyr
#' @export
pillar_select_cols.tbl_lazy <- function(x, n, ...) {
  select(x, !!seq_len(n))
}
```

## Formatting numbers

### Scale Numbers In Columns Equally

https://github.com/r-lib/pillar/issues/96

Idea: Show numbers of the same magnitude with SI prefix in the header.

Solution: Custom vector class/container.

### Respect getOption("digits") if "pillar.sigfig" is unset?

https://github.com/r-lib/pillar/issues/127 (own issue)

Idea: Improve adoption of new users.

Alternative: Show `getOption("digits")` significant figures if the differences are small enough.

### Respect scipen option in base

https://github.com/r-lib/pillar/issues/110

Idea: Avoid switching to scientific notation

Use option?


### Problems

- Change formatting for all columns/containers: solved well enough (except scipen?)

- Specify distinct formatting (e.g. different number of significant figures, avoidance of scientific notation) per column or per container

    - Tag value during creation -- property of the data

        - Needs good name

    - Apply formatting based on column name/type

        - Manually: `collect_spec`

        - Automatically: set option to container

- Useful packages

    - formattable
    
        - extract vector classes to separate package
    
    - units

## Next steps

- Wait for tibble 3.0.6 to appear on RSPM
- Revdepcheck
- Test coverage per file
- Deprecate `format_type_sum()` (how did that even work?)
- Look for FIXMEs
- Use penguins
- Export `tbl()` and `as_tbl()`
- Document all functions
- Rethink `new_pillar_box()` and `pillar_box()`, closer coupling with `new_ornament()`?
- Release
- Improve output:
    - Tibble-local options for precision
    - Classes for numeric and string, use {formattable}
    - Multi-stage output for packed data frames
    - Arrays!
    - Show number of rows if known
    - Show columns that are abbreviated in full
    - Packed data frames and matrices: if too wide, show ellipsis
    - Packed matrices: show type only once
